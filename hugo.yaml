      I am a GIS software developer and spatial data
      scientist focusing on quantitative analysis in policy research,
      leveraging cloud computing technologies and data science methods to facilitate
      impact evaluations on social and environmental infrastructure projects.
      While not working, I like to contribute to open source software, play sports, and doing fun stuff outside. <br />
      <br />
      My career has been always focused on putting data and technology for the social good,
      utilizing my skillset to study the impact of environmental events and infrastructure projects in Latin America.
      I have participated in studies involving the impact of COVID-19 on mobility and transport,
      urban-policy land use regulation impacts on informal housing settlements,
      and I am currently working on studying the impact of hurricanes over economic and electricity service recovery.
