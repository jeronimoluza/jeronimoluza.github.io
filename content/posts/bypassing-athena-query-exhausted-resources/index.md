If you work with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Athena SQL, chances are that you've encountered the following error:

`Query exhausted resources at this scale factor`

This generally indicates that you are hitting memory limits on the Athena cluster that runs your query ([reference 1](https://repost.aws/questions/QU5M0ASE-_R_mvSMXDWrnuDA/athena-version-3-error-query-exhausted-resources-at-this-scale-factor), [reference 2](https://repost.aws/questions/QUdYYEXbb0QMuKX6TwDl17GA/athena-query-exhausted-resources-at-this-scale-factor), [reference 3](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/athena-query-exhausted)). AWS provides several [performance optimization strategies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/performance-tuning.html), including [data optimization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/performance-tuning-data-optimization-techniques.html), [query optimization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/performance-tuning-query-optimization-techniques.html), and [data partitioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/partition-projection.html#partition-projection-using).

This error can often be the result of a cartesian product when performing spatial operations involving a large number of geometries on both sides of the tables being joined. Athena attempts to process every single geometry from the left table with every geometry from the right table, leading to an exponential increase in the number of comparisons. This can overwhelm Athenaâ€™s processing capabilities, causing the engine to "choke" on the amount of data being processed and ultimately resulting in the exhausted resources error.

To avoid this, it is essential to introduce intermediate steps before reaching the final desired result. Instead of performing a direct intersection between all geometries at once, segmenting the operations using progressively larger geometries can significantly reduce the cartesian product. For example, if we want to intersect roads with census tract data for an entire continent, the direct cartesian product between all roads and all census tracts would be computationally overwhelming. Instead, we can introduce intermediate steps:

First, intersect the roads with country geometries.

Then, intersect the resulting roads with province/state geometries.

Next, intersect the resulting roads with municipality geometries.

Finally, intersect the resulting roads with the census tract geometries inside those municipalities.

By structuring the operation into these intermediate steps and storing intermediate results in temporary tables, we can iteratively refine the spatial joins at progressively finer levels of detail. This segmentation prevents Athena from processing an excessive number of comparisons at once, allowing the query to remain within memory constraints.

H3 hexagons provide a natural framework for building this hierarchical structure of intersections by organizing spatial relationships from broader to finer resolutions, moving from parent hexagons to their child hexagons. Each H3 hexagon can be subdivided into smaller hexagons at the next resolution level, so intersections can first be evaluated at a coarser level, where each parent hexagon encompasses multiple child hexagons. This means initial intersections can identify general areas of interest at a lower resolution, while subsequent intersections at higher resolutions focus only on the children of those hexagons where intersections were previously found, reducing the number of comparisons needed at each step and enables scalable geometric operations by narrowing the scope of detailed calculations to smaller, relevant areas. This strategy avoids the otherwise immense cartesian product that results from a direct intersection of a large number of geometries with a dense, high-resolution grid. By gradually filtering data at each level, the process sidesteps Athena's memory constraints and makes it possible to perform detailed geospatial operations in stages.

I've developed a project to create a structured, hierarchical database connecting each coarse hexagon in the grid to its finer-resolution counterparts. The disk size is determined based on the difference between the current and target resolutions, meaning that for each transition to a higher resolution, the algorithm calculates how many neighboring hexagons (in a disk shape) are needed to encapsulate the space covered by the original coarser hexagon, ensuring that each area in the coarse grid is spatially represented by an equivalent group of smaller hexagons in the next resolution level.

As the process moves from one resolution level to the next, it generates a series of databases or tables that capture these hierarchical relationships. Starting with an initial set of parent hexagons at a low resolution, each database created at subsequent levels tracks which finer-resolution hexagons correspond to each hexagon at the previous level. The code ensures this by calculating and storing the exact set of finer hexagons (or "disk") associated with each coarse hexagon. This approach results in a cascading structure of tables, where each level contains a set of spatial mappings that allow intersection operations to proceed in stages, focusing only on increasingly smaller sets of hexagons. This prevents the need for an exhaustive, computationally prohibitive comparison across all hexagons at the highest resolution, enabling efficient and manageable geospatial operations across multiple levels of detail.
