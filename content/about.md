# Hi there, I'm JerÃ³nimo! ðŸ‘‹

My name is JerÃ³nimo Luza, I'm from Mercedes, province of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I am a Spatial Data Scientist focusing on technology and quantitative analysis in policy research.

I'm currently working for the Strategic Planning Division (SPD) at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), where I leverage cloud computing technologies and data science methods to facilitate impact evaluations on social and environmental infrastructure projects.

As a research assistant, I have participated in studies involving the impact of COVID-19 on mobility and transport, urban-policy land use regulation impacts on informal housing settlements, and I am currently working on studying the impact of hurricanes over economic and electricity service recovery.

My data toolkit is composed by:

- Python
- R
- SQL
- Unix/Linux
- Bash
- AWS

While not working, I like contributing to open source software, playing sports, and doing fun stuff outside.

Some of my contributions:

- [EL-BID/UrbanPy](https://github.com/EL-BID/urbanpy)
- [EL-BID/SentinelDownloader](https://github.com/EL-BID/SentinelDownloader)
- [perrygeo/rasterstats](https://github.com/perrygeo/python-rasterstats)
